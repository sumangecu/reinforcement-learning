## Overview

Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. This project aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding RL concepts and algorithms.

## Features

- Implementation of popular RL algorithms.
- Support for OpenAI Gym environments.
- Modular and extensible codebase.
- Visualization tools for training progress.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reinforcement-learning.git
    cd reinforcement-learning
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

## Usage

1. Choose an algorithm and environment to train:
    ```bash
    python train.py --algorithm dqn --env CartPole-v1
    ```

2. Evaluate a trained model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model-path models/dqn_cartpole.pth
    ```

3. Visualize training progress:
    ```bash
    python visualize.py --log-dir logs/
    ```

## Algorithms Implemented

- Multi-armed bandit setting
- Policy Gradient Methods
